# NBA-Player-Performance-Prediction
Machine Learning || Regression Analysis || Python

# Overview
This Jupyter Notebook predicts NBA players' performance metrics (e.g., points scored) based on historical data using machine learning techniques. The notebook involves data exploration, feature engineering, and modeling using regression techniques.

# How to run
Place the csv file and jupyter code file in the same directory

# Features
1. Data Loading and Preparation
2.  Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3.  Feature Engineering
4.  Feature Selection
5.  Modeling
6.  Evaluation
7.  Feature Importance

# Output
Visualizations: Distribution plots, correlation heatmap, and feature importance bar plot.
Metrics:
Linear Regression: R-squared and MAE
Ridge Regression: R-squared and MAE
Selected features and their coefficients for Linear Regression.

# Potential Improvements
Experiment with additional models like Decision Trees or Random Forests.
Optimize hyperparameters using GridSearchCV.
Incorporate advanced time-series analysis for performance prediction.
